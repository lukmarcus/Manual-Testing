## Homework #5

In the «TestLink» system create positive and negative test cases on the following functionality (required):
Account Password recovery (page) 
*Design the test cases on password recovery based on your own experience, do not try finding the steps to reproduce on the site  
New Account registration (page)
*Design no more than two cases for each scenario (positive and negative) 
*In the TestLink system there is a limit of 10 test cases to be designed. The rest of the (6) cases can be designed on any other functionality on the site. 
*The example of test cases can be found in the «TestLink» system, in the «Examples of the corretly designed test cases» folder.

-- 

The bugs found in the process of test case design: 

register in the bug tracker 
assign the "Homework_5" category to the bug reports

--

Create an account and project in TestRail in format "Name_Last Name" (for example John_Dou). Attach a screenshot of the created project to this test.  

* The file format must be: ".png", ".jpeg", ".jpg". Otherwise, the attached file will not be evaluated.

--

In the TestRail project, create at least 2 test sets and at least 4 test cases according to the functionality of the test site (they can be copied from TestLink). One test suite should contain two test cases (one negative and one positive) for testing one site function. The topic of  the test case should be based on the "What? Where? With what type of data?" principle. Since it is impossible to fit all test cases (with all attributes) on one screenshot, attach a screenshot of one of the created test cases with all attributes.    

* The file format must be: ".png", ".jpeg", ".jpg". Otherwise, the attached file will not be evaluated

--

In TestRail create a test plan with arbitrary name and description. Add test run, add all created test cases. Pass test cases (assign statuses) and attach a screenshot with a diagram of the results to this test.    


* The file format must be: ".png", ".jpeg", ".jpg". Otherwise, the attached file will not be evaluated
