### Issue #10
**Summary:** Achievement 'Same as always' unlocked on day 2.

**Steps to reproduce:**
Unknown, impossible to replicate.

**Information:** I loaded the game from the main menu. I was in the bar on day 2. Achievement 'Same as always" popped up. According to the description ('Spend every afternoon at the bar'), I shouldn't get it there. The game was probably loaded a few times so days don't count properly.
