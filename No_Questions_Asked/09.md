### Issue #09
**Summary:** Can't choose dialog options with "space".

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Start a new game.
2. Take the package and go to the first delivery.
3. Go right until the dialog starts.

**Actual result:** Dialog options can't be chosen with "space". I don't know which key can be used.

**Expected result:** Dialog options can be chosen with "space". Till now "space" worked in one-line dialogs. I can use arrows and WS keys to move through dialog options.
