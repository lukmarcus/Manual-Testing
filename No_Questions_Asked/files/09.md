### Issue #09

**Summary:** The dialogue options can't be chosen with the "space" key.

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. Start a new game from the main menu.
2. Pick up the package and go to delivery.
3. Go right until the dialogue starts.
4. Try to press the "space" key.

**Actual result:** The dialogue options can't be chosen with the "space" key. It is not known which key can be used.

**Expected result:** The dialogue options can be chosen with the "space" key. Till now the "space" key worked in one-line dialogue. I can use the arrow keys and W/S keys to move up/down through dialogue options.
