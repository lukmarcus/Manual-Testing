### Issue #10

**Summary:** The 'Same as always' achievement is unlocked on Day 2.

**Steps to reproduce:**
Unknown, impossible to replicate.

**Information:** I loaded the game from the main menu. I was in the bar on day 2 and the 'Same as always' achievement popped up. According to the description ('Spend every afternoon at the bar'), it shouldn't activate at that time. The game was probably loaded a few times in this session so maybe days didn't count properly.
