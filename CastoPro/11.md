#11: Opening and closing the menu is not a button, but narrow elements
**Description:** On pages with a width below 992px, there is a menu button in the upper right corner of the page instead of a full menu. This "button" is not an area but consists of three dashes that are hard to hit with the cursor. When the menu is open, there is the "X" with the same problem, which closes the menu.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Open page `/pl/home`.
2. Change the page width below 992px.

**Actual result:** Open and close menu items are not easy to click.

**Expected result:** Open and close menu items are buttons or larger areas that are easier to click.
