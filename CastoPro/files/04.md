## #04: The correctness of the e-mail on the registration page is validated only after entering the phone number

**Description:** On page `/pl/register`, the correctness of the written e-mail is validated only after entering the phone number. Before that, any e-mail in the format `x@x.xx` is correct:

- wrong domain (`.cmo` instead of `.com`, `.lp` instead of `.pl`, also `.comm`)
- domains that don't exist (e.g., `@gmail.com.pl`)

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. Open page `/pl/register`.
2. Fill the `E-mail` field with the incorrect e-mail address (e.g., `castorama@gmail.cmo`).
3. Click the button `DALEJ`.
4. Fill the `E-mail` field with the incorrect e-mail address (e.g., `castorama@gmail.cmo`).
5. Fill the phone number field (`Telefon`) with the phone number (e.g., `123456780`).
6. Click the button `DALEJ`.

**Actual result:** Information about an incorrect e-mail appears only after entering the phone number.

**Expected result:** Information about an incorrect e-mail appears even without entering a phone number.
