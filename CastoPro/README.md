# CastoPro

## About the job
- **Task:** Find an error on the page
- **Page:** [CastoPro - the loyalty program for professionals | Castorama](https://castopro.castorama.pl/pl/home)
- **Customer:** [SigmaCEM Analytics](https://sigmacem.com/)
- **Environment:** Google Chrome 110.0.5481.100 in Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS
- **Timeframe:** 48h
- **End date:** 2023-03-01

## Additional information
- The most popular web browser was chosen due to the lack of requirements for a specific testing environment and a responsive version.
- It was not clear from the description of the task whether you should test only one page with this exact address or the entire process of registering for the loyalty program.
- When testing the page, I assumed it was the whole site, but I will mention that I noticed only one minor technical error on the main page.
